# Kudi

#### Motivation

I needed a finance app to keep track of my subscriptions. While there are plenty of apps out there, I thought this could be a good learning opportunity to build it myself. I choose Tauri as my techstack, as it provides the familiarity of Vue.JS, but the speed and reliability of Rust. The name `Kudi` comes from the [Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_language) language, and is a translation from the English word `Finances`.

#### Techstack

This app is built with Tauri, using Vue.JS in the frontend and of course Rust in the backend. To store the data, I use a MariaDB SQL server.
